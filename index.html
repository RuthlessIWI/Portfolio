    <p>Since i've been interested in development and operations I was thinking maybe creating a simple app.
        I dont neccessarily know what the app would consist of but creating an app would allow me to dive into the security side of things.
        I could not only work on creating an app but also work on securing that app.
        Maybe an app that allows you to choose a state and view different concerts since i also enjoy music.</p>
